    <p>
        Curious about the underlying architecture of the nteract application?
        Wondering how you can leverage commutable or enchannel in your own
        applications? Looking to hack on something fun over the weekend?
    </p>
    <p>
        You've come to the right place! 
    </p>
    <p>
        These docs are tutorial-style. What does this mean? It means you'll
        learn about the APIs of each library by building an actual application
        or tool that utilizes that library. If you're interested in accessing
        the standard API documentation for our libraries, you can do so by visiting
        nteract.io/${insert-name-of-library-here}. We recommend going throug the tutorial
        for each library first and then using the API documentation to develop!
    </p>
    <p>
        Happy hacking! We believe you will build wonderful things and we want
        to see them! If you create something using nteract's libraries be sure
        to send us a tweet!
