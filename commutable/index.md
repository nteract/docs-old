# commutable

commutable is an nteract library that allows you to interact with a Jupyter Notebook file. Using commutable, you can create a Notebook document, append cells, update outputs, clear outputs, update the content of a cell and much more. commutable is written in [TypeScript]() so type-checking is enforced on all methods. Let's get stated with commutable. We'll be working in the shell and the Node REPL so make sure that you have those handy.

Let's start off by installing commutable. commutable is an npm package so we can install it by using

```
$ npm install commutable
```

Once we've installed it, we can open up our Node REPL and start to interact with its functions. Let's start by importing the commutable package into our context.

```
> const commutable = require("commutable");
```

Now that we have imported the commutable package, we can create our first empty notebook.

```
> const notebook = commutable.emptyNotebook;
> notebook
Map { 
	"cellOrder": List [], 
	"nbformat": 4, 
	"nbformat_minor": 0, 
	"cellMap": Map {}
}
```

An empty Notebook is an [Immutable.js]() Map object that enforces the requirements for version 4 of the notebook format specification. This specification outlines what keys the JSON representing a Jupyter Notebook document should have and how the JSON is structured. In the empty notebook, we have the following keys set up.

* **cellOrder** is a List that contains the IDs of the cell in the order that they appear in the notebook.
* **nbformat** and **nbformat_minor** are used to specify the version of the Jupyter Notebook specification that this notebook complies with.
* **cellMap** is a Map that associates a cell ID with the cell it matches with.

To understand `cellMap`, we'll need to understand how cells are represented in commutable. Let's take a look.

```
> commutable.emptyCodeCell
Map { 
	"cell_type": "code", 
	"execution_count": null, 
	"metadata": Map { 
		"collapsed": false
	}, 
	"source": "", 
	"outputs": List []
}
```

The `emptyCodeCell` object is an Immutable map that contains the data associated with the notebook. This contains things like the `cell_type` (`code` or `markdown`), the `execution_count`, the `source`, and the `outputs`. Let's see if we can add this code cell to the notebook that we created earlier. There is one difference between the way Jupyter formats notebook and the way commutable formats notebooks. commutable requires a unique ID to be associated with each cell for per-cell operations. This ID is stored inside the `cellOrder` list and used as the keys in the `cellMap`. In order to create the unique IDs, we'll need to install the `uuid` library for Node.

```
$ npm install uuid
```

And then require it into our context.

```
> const uuid = require("uuid");
```

We can create a unique ID using the following syntax.

```
> const uniqueId = uuid.v4();
```

Now that we have a unique ID that we can associate with our empty code cell, we can add our empty code cell to our notebook using commutable.

```
> const notebookWithCell = commutable.appendCell(notebook, commutable.emptyCodeCell, uniqueId);
```

Note that the `appendCell` function returns to you a new notebook with the appended cell and does not modify the notebook that you pass it. We now have a notebook with a single empty code cell! :tada:

Now, let's see if we can edit the content of the empty code cell we just added it. With commutable, of course we can!

```
> const notebookWithCell2 = commutable.updateSource(notebookWithCell, uniqueId, "print('a')");
```

This function let's commutable know that we would like to update the source inside the code cell with the ID `uniqueId` in the notebook `notebookWithCell` to `"print('a')"`.

Let's take a look at the notebook object to make sure that this change has been made.

```
> notebookWithCell2
Map { 
	"cellOrder": List [ "da15e63f-8838-482e-9de9-a4444af8acfa" ], 
	"nbformat": 4, 
	"nbformat_minor": 0, 
	"cellMap": Map { 
		"da15e63f-8838-482e-9de9-a4444af8acfa": Map { 
			"cell_type": "code", 
			"execution_count": null, 
			"metadata": Map { 
				"collapsed": false 
			}, 
			"source": "print('a')", 
			"outputs": List [] 
		} 
	}
}
```

Nice! Now let's say that we've used enchannel to send a message to a Python kernel and receive an output for running `print("a")` on the Python REPL. How can we update the output of the code cell?

The outputs of a cell are represented as Immutable Lists to accommodate . So we'll need to install `immutable`.

```
npm install immutable
```

And then require the List object from the `immutable` REPL into our context.

```
> const List = require("immutable").List;
```


```
> const notebookWithOutputs = commutable.updateOutputs(notebookWithCell2, uniqueId, new List(["a"]));
```

Let's take a look at what our notebook with a single code cell with source and outputs looks like.

```
> notebookWithOutputs
Map { 
	"cellOrder": List [ "da15e63f-8838-482e-9de9-a4444af8acfa" ], 
	"nbformat": 4, 
	"nbformat_minor": 0, 
	"cellMap": Map { 
		"da15e63f-8838-482e-9de9-a4444af8acfa": Map { 
			"cell_type": "code", 
			"execution_count": null, 
			"metadata": Map { 
				"collapsed": false 
			}, 
			"source": "print('a')", 
			"outputs": List [ "a" ] 
		} 
	} 
}
```

Sweet! You can repeat this process for for as many code cells as you like! In addition to code cells, you can also create Markdown cells using `commutable.emptyMarkdownCell`. Happy hacking!

## Major :key:s

So what are the main take aways from this tutorial?

* commutable stores everything as an Immutable object.
* commutable functions are non-mutating.
* commutable cells have a unique ID associated with them.
